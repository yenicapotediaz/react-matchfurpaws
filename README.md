# Capstone Product Plan

## Product Plan Components
1. __Problem Statement__: Adopting a pet is a huge commitment that sometimes involves spending time navigating pet adoption websites without being able to filter the type of pet you are looking for. It can also be hard on animal rescues that get tons of applications from adopters that are not a good match for that pet. It can be a hassle to find a match, both for rescues and adopters. I want to create a website that gives the rescue and the adopter a smoother experience during the search for a forever pet. I want to provide a different way of searching for a pet, by providing a more wholesome picture of the adopter and the adoptable pet: create a personality/lifestyle profile that matches based on crucial information about both parties similar to a dating website.
2. __Market Research__:
  - Applicationâ€™s competition - Petfinder, Petango
  - research from users: It can hard to filter that match your lifestyle. Adopters don't want to have to read a bunch of pet profiles that don't match their needs (they live in an apartment and want a dog that is suitable in an apartment environment, dogs that need a backyard would not be suitable). Rescues often get multiple applications for an adoptable pet and have to spend precious time going through each application. Many times, there are a bunch of adopters that are not a good match for that pet. Instead of receiving applications and then filtering them out manually, a rescue would like to have filtered out adopters apply to adopt a pet they are most likely suitable for.
  - differentiation: While Petango has a 'matching' feature, it is not yet there no give an actual match (i.e. an adopter wants a dog that is cat friendly and receives matches with dogs that are not cat friendly) Shelters still have to write all the details in the description part of the pet's profile (it is not displayed in a user friendly way for the adopter to easily see and filter). My proposal is to provide the filtering that adopters and rescues have to do manually and allow them to receive a list of matches that they can then choose from without having to check if they are suitable for each other.
3. __User Personas__: Foster-based rescues and adopters. The rescues will most likely be foster-based since they are able to really get to know the pet's personality and know what type of family/environment they'd be suited for. The adopter is someone looking to find a match rather than a certain breed/type of pet. They are interested in finding a pet that is a good match for their lifestyle/environment.
